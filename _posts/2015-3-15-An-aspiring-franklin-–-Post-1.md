Since I started working 7 years ago, I've been lucky enough to see my earnings increase and my savings grow.  However, I'm still a long way from achieving my goal of achieving financial independence and making work optional.

So I'm starting this blog to cover the way I think about some of life's key financial challenges in the hopes that writing them down will help me achieve a greater clarity and speed me on the journey.

I have a simple three step formula and will be exploring each pieces in more detail.  These are:

1) Maximise the amount I earn by learning new skills and qualifications
2) Spend less than I earn and invest the remainder in a cost efficient way
3) Own assets whose outputs would otherwise be expenses

As I have a busy day job, these posts may be infrequent but hopefully regular.  I live in the UK and so I will end up addressing a number of local issues and make references to UK specific personal tax vehicles (like SIPPs, ISAs etc) but the principles should apply in many other countries around the world.
