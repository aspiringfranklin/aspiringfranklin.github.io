title: The cost of shaving
---
Since I started shaving at the age of 16 I have used a variety of Gillette razor blades.  Without much thought, I have bought replacement blades every couple of months or so at the cost of some £15.

Only recently I began to muse why these small cartridges of plastic and steel cost so much.  There is nothing inherently expensive about the materials, and the manufacturing process has had several decades to reduce the cost of production.

The reality is that razor blades only cost so much because I and many others are prepared to pay for them.  The value of the Gillette brand is famously robust.  Gillette was one of Warren Buffett’s favourite investments, a share he held for over 14 years before selling it to Procter & Gamble for an estimated $4.4bn profit.

I have certainly been one of those customers that helped Mr Buffett achieve such a fabulous return.  Let’s take a look at the current prices.  The basic end of the Gillette Fusion range – the one with the preposterous 5 blades – costs £2 per cartridge.  Gillette claims these remain sharp for “up to a month” but this claim is based on “3 to 4 shaves for three weeks” which is no working month as far as I am concerned.  That equates to 9 to 12 shaves per cartridge, or just under 2 weeks which seems more accurate.

So on annual basis, I am liable to give Gillette £52 plus another £20 or so on shaving cream.  This is a small enough sum that I should probably ignore it, but – like a blunt razor – it still irritates me that something so simple should cost so much.

As with so many branded items, I often find the trick to finding a more frugal alternative is to look to the past.  My grandfather shaved for many years with a [safety razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_razor) and never felt the need for anything better.  I had always been slightly afraid of this form of shaving, coming as it does with loose razor blades sharpened on two edges without any protective plastic casings.

However, I read in various places that this could be a more economical form of shaving, so last month, I bought myself a [Muhle safety razor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003ZVZPU6/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B003ZVZPU6&linkCode=as2&tag=aspiringfranklin-21).  Yes, this is expensive at £25, but it is machined with the precision of a weapon.  There is only one material – stainless steel – which has been polished and knurled in a Rhineland forge.  This razor will almost certainly outlive me.

The actual experience of shaving with it is fine.  After a cautious first week worrying about slicing my face in two, I discovered that it is neither better or worse than any cartridge style razors I have used before.

No, the real joy in this experience was the cost of the blades.  After a bit of digging, I discovered the [Astra safety razor blades](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/100-ASTRA-SUPERIOR-PLATINUM-DOUBLE-EDGE-SAFETY-RAZOR-BLADES-/321839721177).  These can be bought in boxes of 100 at a cost of just £8.  Even treating myself to a new blade every week, with one purchase I have acquired nearly two years of blades and demolished my annual spend on shaving by some 90%.

As a reward for being so frugal, I have now indulged myself in expensive soap from [Taylor of Old Bond Street](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0007MW2ZW/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B0007MW2ZW&linkCode=as2&tag=aspiringfranklin-21).  This turns out to support approximately the same number as shaves as my old Gillette products, so my cost on soap has not changed, leaving me both (marginally) richer and (much) better scented!
