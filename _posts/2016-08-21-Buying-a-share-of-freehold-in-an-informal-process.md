title: Buying a share of freehold in an informal process
---
Last week I completed an 11 month transaction to buy a share of the freehold of my building.  This was a great moment for me as becoming a freeholder - and thereby owning a piece of real property in perpetuity - has been a lifelong goal. 

However, the process so flummoxed the solicitors of all the parties that I feel compelled to write about the process.   

Owning a leasehold along with a share of a freehold is very common in cities in the UK, particularly in London. 

Since the 1970s tens of thousands of Victorian terraced houses, often in rotting post war dilapidation, were bought up by developers and hastily converted into flats. This was the case with my property: first built in 1890, bombed out during the Blitz and then converted into three flats in the late 70s. 

As is common, the developer of my building kept the freehold to himself and sold off leases for the flats.

Before going any further, let me recap on the basics of freehold and leasehold.

A leaseholder is to a freeholder, as a tenant is to a landlord. The only difference is that unlike a tenant, the leaseholder has agreed to pay for many years of rent up front - commonly 99 or even 999 - and has the right to do what it likes to the inside of the property, sell the lease contract to others, and a few other rights. 

The freeholder has the right to charge an ongoing ground rent (typically quite small) and service charges for maintaining the whole building (typically outrageously high).  At the end of the lease term, the leased property reverts to the freeholder.  This combination of income for the term of the lease and the rights to get the property back at the end of the lease are what are valuable about freeholds.  Inevitably leaseholders don’t let their leases run down to zero.  Once they get to around 80 years banks will force leaseholders to renew their leases – paying freeholders handsomely in the process.  By being a freeholder yourself, you capture this value instead.

Leaseholders do have the right, after residing in their property for two years, to buy a share of the freehold from its owners. This is typically done in concert with the other leaseholders in a building in a process called collective enfranchisement.  This is a relatively well worn process, with a body of law and precedent around it.  As there are often many parties - say all the leaseholders in a block of 20 flats - there are typically enough fees at stake to engage a decent solicitor. And as the process is so well documented that it is hard for solicitors to really stumble.

But there is another way to buy a share of the freehold: the informal process.  You are much more likely to be going down this route if you are in circumstances like the following:

* Your leasehold flat is one of only two to four in the building
* The other flat owners bought the freehold from the developer at some time in the past, and your flat's prior owner didn't join the process
* The other flat owners are relatively friendly and willing to involve you in the property management process

I was in exactly these circumstance a year ago, having bought the leasehold on my flat.  The other two flat owners had bought the freehold from its owner 3 years previously and unfortunately the prior owner of my flat had declined to get involved in the process.

Although the process for me to buy in ended up taking nearly a year, when I look back I realise there are only five steps to successfully buying a freehold in an informal process:

*Step 1 - Find out how the freehold shares are owned and governed*

This may be as shares in a limited company, which itself owns the freehold.  This is likely if there are 4 or more flats in the building.  Alternatively, the ownership may be governed through a Declaration of Trust.  This is a deed signed by the freeholders.  Like most things in law this sounds very fancy, but is in fact just a three page document which specifies – among other things – who owns what percentage of the freehold, how freeholders must act when selling their leaseholds, and how the freeholds will handle any disputes relating to the management of the property.

You can find out how your target freehold is owned by buying a copy of the freehold title document from the [Land Registry](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry).

*Step 2 - Agree a price with the other freeholders*

This is a crucial step to the informal process as there is no procedure to fall back on if the parties fall out and price is most likely to be a source of disagreement.  Get your sellers onside with the price before you do anything else!

As it happens, my sellers and I agreed on a price by inflating the price they had paid five years ago by the Zoopla price increase reported in our postcode.

Another method could be using the valuation process from Collective Enfranchisement.  This uses a formula to calculate the terminal value of the property (ie, the price when it reverts back to the freeholder), discounted back to the present day.  Interestingly, the discount rate is set in law at 5% (_Cadogan vs Sportelli_).  Clearly in a world of close to zero interest rates this is way too high and means that the price to buy a freehold today is significantly lower relative to other assets.  This significantly favours buyers over sellers.  There's a [good calculator here](http://www.freeholdcalculator.com/freehold.php) that takes your inputs (leasehold price, number of remaining years on the lease etc) and shows what you should be paying the freeholders.

In my case the other freeholders and I came to a speedy agreement on price.  They were actually just happy to have someone else in the building, sharing maintenance workload.  I’m sure I could have pushed harder on price, but I wanted to make sure everyone walked away a winner.  Given how tough the next two processes were, I’m glad I did...

*Step 3 - Find a solicitor who knows how to complete the process at a reasonable price (and in a reasonable time frame)*

I used my solicitor from my leasehold transaction, which was probably the right thing to do.  However, if I was doing this again I would ask many more diligence questions before starting the process, specifically: when was the last time you managed a share of freehold sale or purchase?  What documents have to be prepared and by which party?

More importantly I would have asked the seller’s solicitor (ie, the one acting for the incumbent freeholders) these same questions, as this was the weak link in the entire process.

*Step 4 - Have the seller's solicitor prepare the documents*

Unfortunately the standard in property transactions is that the seller’s solicitor prepares the legal documents.  In my case, the lead incumbent freeholder had a dreadful solicitor who gave the work to the most junior member of the firm.  This person had essentially no idea what they were doing, and took nearly eight months to redraft the existing Declaration of Trust.  This was quite an achievement, given the whole document was only three pages long, and the solicitor only had to change it in three places.

The only other document required was a TR1 form.  This is submitted to the Land Registry and recognises the change in ownership.  It is a very simple form, and again could have been prepared in a matter of minutes by a competent solicitor.

Note that the TR1 form only puts the names of the freeholders on the title.  It doesn’t record their relative ownerships, nor what will happen when freeholders sell their flats, nor how freeholders will resolve disputes.  This is why the Declaration of Trust is important, as it covers those matters.

*Step 5 - Sign the documents, pay up and submit the form to the Land Registry*

As with a normal property purchase, you'll need to send your consideration to your solicitor who will hold it escrow until the sellers' solicitors have received signed documents.

Then all the parties will exchange: money for signed documents.  At this point, your solicitor can file the TR1 at the Land Registry, and you are now a freeholder!



Hopefully this helps someone else one day!  My process could have been done in a month if all the parties knew what they were doing.  However, now it is done, I can relax and enjoy the benefits.  What benefits?  Well, now I and the other freeholders can extend our leases, which will keep the bank happy.  I can also contribute to maintaining the building, which will help keep our service fees low and ensure that the work is being done to a high standard.  Finally, I can rest easy at night knowing that I am one step closing to financial independence.
