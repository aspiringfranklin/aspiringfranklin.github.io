title: House prices in the UK are too low
---
There is a lot of hand-ringing over house prices in the UK, with the more hyperactive commentators prone to describing house prices as being in a “bubble”.  While there is no strict definition of an asset price bubble, it is commonly understood to mean prices that are excessive relative to intrinsic value.

Prices for houses in the UK are high, but I don’t believe there are any strong indications that they are high relative to value.

The value of any asset is driven by the present value of its future income streams, through the relationship:

<p align="center">
  price = yield / r<sub>re</sub> – g
</p>

Looking at value this way, we can see there might be three reasons why house prices could be excessively high relative to value.

* **Yield is too high and will revert back to a reasonable rate.**  The yield from housing is rent (or imputed rent if you are an owner-occupier) and measured by the number of column inches, rental rates would seem high.  Indeed if rents had become disconnected with wages, one could argue that rents would eventually fall as households decide to cut back and live in more affordable homes.  But rents haven't become disconnected from wages.  In the country as a whole rents have grown in line with wages, according to the ONS.  So I don’t believe there is a strong case that rental rates are worse now relative to wages than 10 years ago, nor that rents are too high.

* **The long term growth rate (g) will fall.**  As we’ve seen, the historic growth rate for rents have more or less moved in line with wages.  There is no reason to suspect this relationship won’t continue.  So as long as wages continue to rise (another story) then the long term growth rate in rents will remain stable at around 2-3%.  But there is another factor working to increase demand for homes: household formation.  This is actually forecast to increase faster than population, which will add extra pressure on the demands for homes.  So if anything, there is a strong argument that the long term growth rate in rents will increase, not fall.

* **The discount rate for houses (r<sub>re</sub>) is too low and will increase.**  r<sub>re</sub> is the discount rate for housing and it itself is made up of two main components:

<p align="center">
  r<sub>re</sub> = r<sub>f</sub> + beta(r<sub>erp</sub>)
</p>

* We can ignore beta as for the market as a whole it is 1
* r<sub>f</sub> is the risk free rate – this is the yield of government bonds.  These have been hitting all time lows in the wake of Brexit, and even before then were at historic lows.  The reasons why this is the case are extermely interesting.  When he left the Fed, Ben Bernanke became a part time blogger and wrote an excellent series of posts on [why interest rates are so low](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2015/03/30/why-are-interest-rates-so-low/).  Bottom line: low rates are a product of market forces and are here to stay for as long as the world is experiencing a savings glut and secular stagnation.  This factor will work to keep house values high
* The real estate risk premium (r<sub>erp</sub>) is the extra rate of return investors (or just buyers) demand over the risk free rate.  This is hard to determine a priori and in equity markets is usual found by rearranging the equation, since price is always available.  Let’s look at one market frequently argued to be one of the most overpriced in the world: London

As you can see, the rental yield has remain more or less constant, during a time when prices have risen.  We know that the risk free rate has fallen dramatically since 2006, which means that for the yield to stay constant while prices are rising means that the real estate rise premimum has actually _fallen_.  This means investors are actually demanding a higher return for investing in property.  The fact that risk premiums have risen suggests to me that property is undervalued given current and expected future interest rates.  I suspect this is because most investors believe that interest rates will soon rise.  I believe they will be waiting for some time.

All this matters for someone pursuing financial independence because housing is such a large part of our spending.  [As I’ve argued](http://www.aspiringfranklin.com/buy-or-rent/), the best way to reduce this cost is to buy and through this kind of analysis I continue to believe that is the right decision.
