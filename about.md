I'm a late 20 something working in London.  Like all in my generation I face a future of spiralling housing costs, high taxes to pay for an ageing society and a distant retirement date for myself.  Unlike most of my generation, I spend a lot of time thinking about why these generational imbalances exist and how I can find ways of improving my lot through careful planning and investing.

I'm lucky enough to work in a job that pays well and to have a hobby (personal finance) that is helping me to achieve my main goal: to become a modern day franklin.

To those not familiar with the medieval system of feudalism, a franklin was a freeman but not of noble birth.  Unlike serfs they were not tied to land owned by nobility, instead owning their own real property.

Like my medieval predecessors, I believe ownership of real property is the key to unlocking the freedom of a modern franklin, as it reduces the influence of the modern nobility: employers, rentiers and the state.

The goal of this site is to help me structure my own thinking in order to achieve my modest ambition.  If anyone finds it interesting, then that is a bonus!
